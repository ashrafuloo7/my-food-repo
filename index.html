        <p>Hi,i'm lisa.Healthy eating is important for everyone, but certain foods are especially good for issues that affect women -- like brittle bones, pregnancy, and breast cancer, to name a few. These "super foods" are rich with nutrients (often more than one!) that will help to protect your body and keep it working well, even as you age</p>

        <p>A recipe is a formula of ingredients and a list of instructions for creating prepared foods. It is used to control quality, quantity, and food costs in a foodservice operation. A recipe may be simple to complex based on the requirements of the operation and the intended user. For example, an experienced chef may need a recipe with only a few details, while a beginner cook may need more information about ingredients, preparation steps, cooking times and temperatures, visual cues, and equipment requirements. </p>
